This is a plugin creating a shorter URL of post, page and media permalink.

== Description ==

The **Short link maker** WordPress creating a shorter URL of post, page and media permalink.
The URL in the href attribute defaults to the id number of the post in question.

Example:

    `http://example.com/archives/1606 -> http://example.com/Bb`


This plugin automatically creates a link element in the <head> section of the post's page with a rel="shorturl" attribute. 
It also creates an HTTP `Link` header that also points to the shorter link.


The <link> element looks like this:

    `<link rel="shorturl" href="{url}" />`


The HTTP header is:

    `Link: <{url}>; rel=shorturl`
